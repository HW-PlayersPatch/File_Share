## 2.205 Patch Summary - July 5th, 2016
Gearbox's 2.205 [Patch Preview](http://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/announcement-public-patch-preview/1512431/1) resolved most of the [2.1 Patch Balance Issues](https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/2-1-patch-balance-issues/1512184/1). Unfortunately Gearbox ended support for HWR prior to rolling this out as a full patch. The 2.205 Patch Preview can be opted into on Steam as a beta, or downloaded as part of the 2.3 Players Patch.

### Hiigaran and Vaygr 
__Gunplats__
Damage vs fighters +100% (A typo gave them less damage than intended)
Damage vs hw2 resource collectors -43%
Accuracy vs frigates and capital-ships 40%->80%

__Interceptors/Assault Craft__
Damage vs corvettes -31%
Damage vs frigs and capital-ships -60%
Damage vs subsystems +40%

__Bombers__
Accuracy vs corvettes 80%->20%
Damage vs frigates +40%

__Destroyers__
Health +6%
Normal Unit Caps 5->6

__Battlecruisers__
Health +13%

__Platform Modules on carriers__
Health +25%

__Fighter, Corvette, and Frigate Modules on carriers__

Damage vs hw2 resource collectors -45%




### Hiigaran
__Ion Platforms__
Damage vs idle fighters/probes increased a lot

__Gunship Corvettes__
Damage vs fighters +13%

__Pulsar Corvettes__
Damage vs fighters/probes increased 100%

__Torpedo Frigates__
Damage vs hw2 resource collectors increased 30% (only helps vs upgraded hw2 collectors)
Damage vs fighters/probes increased 100%

__Flak Frigates__
Damage vs hw1 fighters increased 64% (results in a decent buff)

__Battlecruisers__
Range +3%
Fixed an issue where the hiigaran battlecruiser would sometimes sit pointed 10 degrees up or down vs a target on the same vertical level - causing the nose of the ship to block one ion turret from attacking.

__Motherships__
Speed Upgrade Cost 600->400
Health Upgrade Cost 1000->800

__Carriers__
Speed Upgrade Cost 600->400
Health Upgrade Cost 1000->800

Build Time 85->75 seconds (was 75 in hw2c)
Speed Upgrade Cost 600->400
Health Upgrade Cost 1000->800
Health Upgrade Research Time -50%




### Vaygr
Re-balanced the Vaygr unit caps, to allow for fair transferring between players of different races. Interceptors/Bombers now count as 5 supply, and Missle/Laser Corvettes count now as 3 supply. Unit caps have been updated appropriately.

__Missile Corvettes__
Damage vs fighters -55% (they now perform closer to hw2c)
Fixed a bug where they would deal zero damage to probes

__Laser Corvettes__
Fixed a bug with the attack script where laser corvettes would start doing evasive maneuvers and rarely attacking. This bug fix makes laser corvettes much more effective.

__Assault Frigates__
Cost 500->650 (was 650 in hw2c)
Research Time +12% (to same as hw2c)
Damage vs Hiig/Vaygr fighters -50% (results in a small nerf)
Damage vs hw1 fighters +400% (results in a decent buff)

__Battlecruisers__
Trinity Cannon Range +1%
Damage vs capital-ships -6% (with no micro, makes 1 hiigaran cruiser vs 1 vaygr cruiser consistently come out even like in hw2c. With micro, vaygr can slightly out-range hiigaran and win.)

__Carriers__
Cost 1900->2100

__Capital Ship Health Upgrade__
Cost 3000->4000 (to balance vs Hiig)
Research Time +5%

__Capital Ship Speed Upgrade__
Cost 1500->2000 (to balance vs Hiig)
Research Time +33%

### Kushan and Taiidan

Damage vs corvettes -50%
Damage vs hw2 resource collectors -25%

__Ion Frigates__
Ion Cannon Research Time up 35->64 (same timing, considering the capital ship chassis research buff)
Damage vs frigates -24% (they still beat hw2 ion frigates with 10% health left. This was a big oversight in balance testing the 2.0 patch.)

__Motherships__
Damage vs fighters +25%
Can now target any ship (previously couldn't target some ships)

__Carriers__
Damage vs fighters +25%
Damage vs hw2 resource collectors -45%
Can now target any ship (previously couldn't target some ships)

__Destroyers__
Cost 1800->2500 (to balance vs hw2 destroyer ship and upgrade costs)

# 2.3 Players Patch Changes
[details=Click to view]
## 2.3 Players Patch Summary - build 10 - August 31, 2019
The community created [2.3 Players Patch](https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/homeworld-remastered-2-3-players-patch/1639142/1) resolves many balance issues and bugs from the 2.1 Patch. It includes the changes from Gearboxâ€™s unfinished 2.205 Patch Preview, plus many additional improvements. It enhances multiplayer and singleplayer while respecting Gearbox's direction, and the feel of Relic's classics. Notably it fixes the 666 Formation Bug, the Cross Race Docking Bug, and is authored by the players who helped Gearbox balance Homeworld Remastered.



## Gameplay Options and Features
Gearbox/Relic partially developed some of these options, but never implemented them in the game. By popular demand, they have now been added to HWR:
-Added a Mission Difficulty adjuster. At the start of each campaign mission, extra enemy AI reinforcement ships and RU are added based on your fleet size and RU. This dynamic scaling difficulty can now be adjusted.
-Added a Vast unit cap option. This is double the size of Huge, and only recommended for very fast machines.
-Added an AI Attack Damage adjuster to multiplayer and player vs cpu. This can be used to increase the AI's attack damage for a more challenging game.
-Added an Observer mode to spectate multiplayer matches. When prompted to continue watching, click yes to observe.
-Added a Dual Command mode to allow one player to control two fleets. Change your race to a Dual Command race, and then change a CPU ally to the same Dual Command race. You will start with two fleets, double the starting RUs, double the research costs, and will have double the unit caps.
-Added a Camera Pan Speed adjuster. This lets players increase the camera speed to move around maps faster with the arrow keys and edge of screen mouse pan.
-Added a Camera Rotation Speed adjuster. This lets players increase the camera speed to rotate faster with the right mouse button.
-Added a Camera Max Zoom adjuster. This lets players increase the maximum distance the camera can zoom out before having to use the sensors manager.
-Added a Max Tactical Overlay level that keeps unit feedback lines and ability spheres on all the time if desired.
-Added an option set the Default Tactical Overlay. This adjusts the default level of detail for the tactical overlay around units.
-Added an option to Show Base Production Times. This displays the base production times for ships and research items in the production popup menus. The value of research modifiers are also shown.
-Added a Build/Research/Launch Panel adjuster. This lets players set and save the size of the Build/Research/Launch menus in the options. Previously these were adjustable, but their size was not saved across games.



## HWR Bugs Fixes and Improvements
-Addressed the major Cross Race Docking Bug. Fighters and corvettes will now only dock with ships from their own race. Previously, regenerated Hiigaran/Vaygr ships would be unable to launch from Kushan/Taiidan Repair Corvettes, Support Frigates, and Resource Controllers leading to major game lag and multiple glitches.
-Prevented attempting to hyperspace ships inside a hyperspace inhibitor. This resolves the exploit to reset marine/infiltrator frigate capture progress for free, which previously rendered them useless. This hyperspace in gravity well exploit has finally been fixed!
-When salvage corvettes latch on and return enemy frigate/capital ships to their mothership or carrier, an exploit allowed those ships to be scuttled right before they were captured. This prevented salvage corvettes from capturing frigate/capital ships, however the salvage scuttle exploit has now been fixed!
-Addressed kamikaze exploits that allowed cheap ships to kill expensive ships, and that allowed squadrons to kill targets and then dock-heal for free.
-When a docking squadron is under attack, they sometimes glitch out and stop moving. Affected Squadrons are now automatically issued another dock order to dock with the closest ship.
-The Kushan/Taiidan Gravity Well ability previously continued to lock down strikecraft in an area after it had moved away. The area of affect now stays with the Gravity Well.
-Fixed the bug that allowed Kushan/Taiidan players to build two research ships at once on separate carriers.
-Fixed the build/research/launch menu scaling problem, that primarily affects 4k resolutions
-Fixed the build and research queue pause buttons, so that they no longer get disabled
-Improved the spacing in the build/research queues for better readability.
-Fixed the race specific research tabs, so that they are hidden based on the race your playing
-Slightly changed the advanced research module icon to differentiate it more from the regular research module icon.
-Kushan/Taiidan accuracy reduction abilities are now painted orange in the tactical overlay
-The score screen now treats ru spent on subsystems the same as ru spent on research for the building and research score total.
-When a private message is sent, everyone in the lobby hears the audio alert even when they are not the recipient. As a workaround the audio alert has been removed, as the chat window already visually flashes for the recipient.
-Improved parade formations for resource collectors, to reduce collisions with the motherships.
-Fixed Hiigaran Gunship weapon sound effects (they were playing pulsar sounds)
-Hiigaran Marine Frigates, Vaygr Infiltrator Frigates, and all Minelayer corvettes are no longer included in the military selection priority. This prevents accidentally de-latching capture frigates, or messing up mine walls.
-â€˜Platform Completeâ€™ audio is now played for Vaygr Gun Platforms and Missile Platforms.
-Fixed Taiidan Resource Controller nlips clipping (docked collectors would appear inside the controller when zoomed out)
-'Resource Controller Complete' audio is now played for Taiidan Resource Controllers
-The 'Research Ship Complete' audio is now played after each additional Kushan/Taiidan Research Ship Hub is built.
-Kushan Research Ship's with all six hubs, now spin like they did in hw1c.
-Kushan/Taiidan corvettes now respond quickly to certain attack orders, without a long delay.
-Removed Kushan/Taiidan repair ships from military selection priority.
-Kushan/Taiidan repair ships now have a continuous beam like hw1c
-Kushan/Taiidan Repair Corvette heal beams now originate from the correct locations (previously they were healing from their guns).
-Fixed Kushan and Taiidan Repair Corvette sound effects (so they no longer play gun noises while repairing)
-Kushan Ion Cannon Frigates are now pronounced correctly as 'Cannon', previously they were being pronounced as 'Cannit'.
-'Frigate Complete' audio is now played for Taiidan Ion Frigates
-Fixed Kushan Destroyer ion cannon sound effects
-Fixed the player colors on the Kushan Heavy Cruiser ion turrets.
-Reduced the Kushan probe death explosion to an appropriate size.
-'Generator Complete' audio is now played for Taiidan Cloaked Generators
-Fixed Taiidan's Emperor voice, when playing the 'Homeworld 1 Deathmatch' game type (it was playing Vaygr's Makaan voice)
-Expert Taiidan AI now harvests resources at the same rate as the other races. (it was 10% higher by mistake)
-Fixed a bug that prevented the Crates gameplay option from granting ships.
-The 'No Cruisers' game option text now displays in your current locale language rather than always in English.
-In the carrier only gamemode, all races now start with the same number of carriers.
-In the Strikecraft & Support Only game mode, Kushan Drone Technology research is now disabled as intended.
-In the Strikecraft & Support Only game mode, Vaygr carrier health now matches the other races as intended.
-Reduced the amount of small low-RU debris for destroyers and cruisers. This improves the game's performance in long games.
-Fixed the Turanic Carrier Engine missing icon. (v2.205 fix)
-Fixed Hiigaran Mothership visual errors, mainly the badge being cut off. (v2.205 fix)

## Campaign
__Homeworld 1__
-Fixed a rules of engagement bug that caused many Turanic, Kadeshi, and Junkyard ships to sometimes stop attacking unexpectedly and behave passively.
-Updated the parade formations to better handle salvaged ships.
-Fixed the Turanic Missile Corvette's missile burn effects.
-Captured Turanic Standard Corvettes can now be repaired.
-Captured Turanic Ion Array Frigates and Kadeshi Multi-beam Frigates can now be retired immediately.
-Increased Turanic Ion Array Frigate speed to be relatively similar to hw1c.
-Updated research costs to match multiplayer, and research times to 1.5x slower than multiplayer (the campaign research is slower paced). These hadn't been updated since HWR v1.0. Mission resources were also adjusted to support the changes.
-Properly balanced kushan ships vs swarmers to better reflect hw1c gameplay. Corrected swarmer behavior so they dock correctly, and don't stop attacking unexpectedly.
__Mission 3__
-Increased the cryo tray health to be closer to hw1c gameplay. (Gearbox increased the health on most Kushan/Taiidan ships to balance vs Hiigaran/Vaygr upgrades, but forgot some campaign only ships).
__Mission 4__
-Bentusi Trade research costs have been increased to align with normal research costs. However if your in a bind, you may be offered a discount.
-The objective is now complete as soon as the carrier is killed, rather than after the explosion animation finishes (to prevent a timing error).
__Mission 6__
-Bentusi Trade research costs have been increased to align with normal research costs. However if your in a bind, you may be offered a discount.
__Mission 7__
-The enemy AI reinforcements now work properly based on your starting fleet value.
-Fixed an issue where the multi-gun corvette research sometimes doesn't get enabled. 
__Mission 8__
-Increased kadesh multi-beam frigate health and speed to be relatively similar to hw1c.
-Lowered the accuracy of the kadesh mothership ion cannons vs moving fighters and corvettes.
-Kadesh ships now properly defend the final area like in hw1c.
__Mission 10__
-Fixed the camera location at the start of the mission.

__Homeworld 2__
-Fixed a rules of engagement bug that caused Keeper ships to sometimes stop attacking unexpectedly and behave passively.
-Applied some research cost/build time changes from the 2.0, 2.1, and 2.205 patches. These changes were made in multiplayer, but were accidently missed in the campaign. The campaign research stats now better match multiplayer.
-The base health of Vaygr missile platforms, destroyers, cruisers, and flagships have been slightly tweaked to align with multiplayer as they did in hw2c.
__Mission 2__
-The mothership's engine speed now matches the audio cues and hw2c.
-The transport ships' speed now increases after events as they did hw2c. 
-Increased Captain Soban's weapon damage to match hw2c.
__Mission 5__
-Lowered the Vaygr captial ship health upgrade to be closer to hw2c. (this was unintentionally altered in the 2.0 patch)
__Mission 13__
-Lowered the Vaygr corvette, frigate, and captial ship health upgrades to be closer to hw2c. (these were unintentionally altered in the 2.0 patch)



# Balance - August 31, 2019 Note
The balance information below is as of **build 9 from August 17, 2018**. We are currently working to update it for build 10 from August 31, 2019 which included many balance refinements. Most importantly Kushan and Taiidan research costs went up too high in build 9, and have been reduced accordingly in build 10. Fighters -1100ru, Corvettes -1500ru, Frigates -1100ru, Capitals -4700ru, and Non-Combat -700 for a total of -9100ru. The full Build 10 balance change list will be available soon.



## Balance
Many of the balance changes are from Gearbox's 2.205 Patch Preview, as described above. Additional changes are listed below.



### All Races
-Fixed the major [666 Formation Targeting Bug](https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/666-formation-targeting-bug/1541832/1) - Formations and squadrons now perform as they were intended to!
-With the 666 bug resolved, all fighters and corvettes went through a very thorough balance testing process. Tweaks were made as needed to align them with intended balance that Gearbox and the balance testers had crafted.
-Balanced dock repair times for fighters and corvettes (addressed a bug that caused squadrons to dock extremely fast. hw2 ships now repair slower, closer to their hw2c rate. hw1 corvettes repair 4.5x faster than before, to balance vs hw2.)
-Lowered death/scuttle blast range on carriers and battle cruisers (so fighters and corvettes can better survive capital ship battles)
-Hyperspace exit damage lowered from 25% to 10%, when running into a hyperspace inhibitor
-High Unit Caps adjusted so cruisers are capped at 3, rather than 4.
-Tweaked rotational speeds on some units, for example to aid in positioning motherships around asteriod patches.
-Removed evasive stance bonuses from non-combat/utility ships (evasive stance re-routes power from weapons to engines, however this is not possible on non-combat ships and had no effect in hw1c)
-Kamikaze damage adjusted on some units to close potential exploits, and resolve typos.
-Tweaked ship damage vs resourcing units, to be closer to the classics.
-Thousands of ship vs ship tests have been performed with Gearbox's developer balance testing tools, to fine tune combat performance.

__Probes__
-Cost 70->100 +43% (half way between hw1c and hw2c)
-Health 800->400 -50% (its now half way between hw1c and hw2c, as some ships were taking too long just to kill a probe.)



### Hiigaran and Vaygr 
__Resource Collectors__
-Upgraded Health 5000->4000 -20% (to match hw2c)

__Gun Platforms__
-Speed 100->125 +25% (to match hw2c)

__Ion Platforms, Missile Platforms__
-Speed 100->125 +25% (to match hw2c)
-Damage -16% (same as hw2c)

__Bombers__
-Damage vs corvettes -30%

__Minelayer Corvettes__
-Cost 800->400 -50% (buff, hw1 are 275)
-Damage bonus in aggressive stance 1.32->1.1 -17%

__Destroyers__
-Health 85k->90k +6% (+13% over v2.1, closer to hw2c when upgraded by popular demand)



### Hiigaran
__Bombers__
-Speed Upgrade Costs 600->400 (to balance vs Vaygr)
-Hiigaran bombers now check their line of fire like the other races do, to avoid friendly fire incidents

__Pulsar Corvettes__
-Damage vs hw2 corvettes -33% (to balance vs Vaygr)
-Damage vs frigates -10%

__Defense Field Frigates__
-Cost 1000->1250 +25% (to match hw2c)
-Build Time 60->70 +17% (to match hw2c)
-Health 20k->25k +25% (since this ship can't be upgraded, Taiidan Field Frigate is 30k)

__Shipyards__
-Addressed a gun alignment bug. They were shooting to the side of their targets, and rarely landing hits vs small targets like probes, fighters, and corvettes.



### Vaygr
__Resource Collectors__
-Resource capacity 208->200 -4% (Now matches Hiigaran to better balance harvesting. Vaygr still start with one extra collector to make up for their Flagship's long collector drop off route. Harvesting for all four races is now within 1% of each other.)

__Platforms__
-Health Upgrade Costs 1500->1600 (to balance vs Hiigaran)

__Hyperspace Platforms__
-Build Time 45->20sec (these took too long to setup)
-Speed 650->600 -8% (to match hw2c as they should not be faster than a probe)

__Scouts__
-Addressed a gun alignment bug. They were shooting to the side of their targets, and rarely landing hits vs small targets like probes and fighters.

__Corvettes__
-Health Upgrade Costs 1600->1800 (to balance vs Hiigaran)

__Missile Corvettes__
-Damage vs hw1 fighters +110% (now performs similarly vs hw1 and hw2 fighters)

__Laser Corvettes__
-Laser Corvettes were the only corvettes negatively impacted by the 666 Bug. They are now performing as intended: the best anti-frigate and anti-capital ship corvette in the game.

__Command Corvettes__
-Build time 30->45sec +50% (slows down the replenishment of these powerful units)
-Attack/accuracy bonus range -51% (forces these ships to be on the front line so they can be countered)

__Heavy Missile Frigates__
-Range -6% (closer to hw2c)


### Kushan and Taiidan
-Overhauled Kushan and Taiidan. These races were rushed into HWR at release, and repeatedly band-aided over the previous patches. All ship speeds, health, costs, build times, and research costs/times are now consistently translated into the HWR engine, with a robust design methodology. Kushan and Taiidan now feel much more like hw1 classic, while being better balanced against Hiigaran and Vaygr.
-Harvesting for all four races is now within 1% of each other at the 10, 20, and 30 minute marks. Previously hw1 was behind hw2 at 10mins, and ahead at 30minutes. Harvesting is also now better balanced on maps with different asteriod layouts.
-Generally research costs have gone up, while research times have come down. This improves balance vs hw2 upgrade costs, while allowing hw1 to tech up faster, eliminating some pain points.
-Adjusted base health to remove hidden armour modifiers from all ships other than frigates. Relic only applied armour modifiers to frigates, however Gearbox used them sporadically on hw1 units. The ship health values listed below are the actual effective health.
-Corvettes now move around their targets a lot more in combat (similar to hw1c)
-Race specific unit abilities now perform closer to hw1c, details are below.
-Many changes below are to make ships relatively similar to hw1c, while also providing for better balance vs hw2 races.

-Cost 600->500 -17%
-Build Time 50->40sec -20%
-Health 6000->5000 -17%
-Speed 110->206 +87% (to match assault frigates speed like hw1c)
-Resource capacity 500->250 -50%

__Resource Controller__
-Health 27500->30000 +9%
-Speed 100->190 +90%

__Research Ships__
-Build Time 50->45sec -10% (the first hub now builds as fast as the rest)
-Speed 100->175 +75%
-Taiidan Health 30k->45k +50% (to match Kushan Health and fix a mistake from the 2.1 patch)

__Scouts__
-Build Time 10->8sec -20%
-Sensors range -9% (scouting was too hard to deny)
-Speed burst ability duration 50->30secs -40%
-Kushan and Taiidan Scouts are now balanced, previously Kushan would always win. (Not intended)

__Interceptors__
-Fighter Drive Research Cost 100->500, Time 25->14sec
-Fighter Chassis Research Cost 200->800, Time 35->21sec
-Build Time 7->9sec +29% (was funny to have interceptors build faster than scouts)

-Built Time 18->15sec -17%
-Health 108->300 +178%
-Attack style is now closer to hw1c. Their laser weapon has been adjusted to be more consistent, and it now prioritizes mines over missiles.
-Added an accuracy reduction within the field of -1% (similar to Field Frigates, but a smaller effect)

__Repair Corvettes__
-Build Time 20->16sec -20%
-Speed 255->320 +25% (to be able to heal the fastest corvette)

-Capital Ship Chassis Research Cost 1400->1500, Time 85->64sec
-Cost 800->700 -13%
-Build Time 68->60sec -12%
-Now prioritize attacking corvettes over frigates.
-Rebalanced weapons to be more consistent vs fighters and corvettes, by increasing accuracy and decreasing damage.

__Carriers__
-Super Capital Ship Drive Research Cost 1300->1700, Time 71->35sec
-Cost 3000->3500 +17% (with a frigate module Hiigaran is 3800 and Vaygr is 3100)
