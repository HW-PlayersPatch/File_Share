# Homeworld Remastered 2.3 Players Patch
# Build 14 Change List | March 7, 2020

## HWR Bugs Fixes and Improvements
* Fixed an issue where Ion Frigates would sometimes not align their vertical pitch with their target properly.
* Other than cruisers, all captured units can now be retired immediately like hw1c.
* Increased the unit limits for the Capital Phalanx, Frigate Line, Fighter Screen, and Wall strike groups/formations. They can now hold a total of 66 units, which appears to be the max in the HWR engine. Class limits are set to 65 fighters, 66 corvettes, 54 frigates, 7 destroyers, 3 cruisers, and 64 resource units.
* Fixed the player colors on the Kushan Destroyer ion turrets.

## Campaign Improvements
### Homeworld 2
* Sajuuk's hyperspace recovery and transit time now match the Dreadnaught, previously it was very slow.

## Balance
* Fighters and corvettes in evasive stance now do 20% less damage (Aggressive 120%, Neutral 100%, Evasive 100%->80%).
