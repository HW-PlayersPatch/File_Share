Potential ideas for a future build. TBD.

HW2 Scouts
Cost 300->350
Undo this buff and restore hw2c value.

HW2 Interceptors
Cost 450->500
Undo this buff and restore hw2c value.

Hiig Defense Field Frigate
Cost 1000->1250
Build Time 60->70
Undo these buffs and restore hw2c values.

Vaygr Command Corvette

Build Time 45->30
Undo this nerf and restore hw2c value.

Maybe change all probes from probearmour back to unarmoured. Test ships time to kill (including missile corvs) vs them.

Maybe change research ship from resarmour to mediumarmour.

Hiig Marine
Max hyperspace cost 450->500
To match other hiig frigates and restore hw2c.

Vay Shipyard Hyperspace

command corvette retalliationRange
5500->2000. like you changed minelayers/capture frigs/repair units before. don't want it running off to die.

In 2.1, kamikazying interceptors is insane!!! Mention this exploit fix in 2.3 change log... collisionMultiplier
 35.0->0.35 rofl

hw1 colls should start in defensive, not passive... only ships to start in passive.
