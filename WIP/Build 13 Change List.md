# Updated as of 12/12


# Homeworld Remastered 2.3 Players Patch
# Build 13 Change List | December ??, 2019

## Gameplay Options and Features
* Added an option to change the Stance Buttons Order. This changes the order of the stance buttons in the UI to match HWR (Aggressive/Evasive/Neutral) or hw1c (Aggressive/Neutral/Evasive).

## HWR Bugs Fixes and Improvements
* The retaliation range has been reduced significantly on many special ability units. This is to prevent them from moving towards a distant battle on their own, which often leads to them dying without utilizing their special ability. This includes Hiigaran/Vaygr Minelayer Corvettes, Hiigaran Marine Frigates, Hiigaran Defense Field Frigates, Vaygr Infiltrator Frigates, Kushan/Taiidan Repair Corvettes, Minelayer Corvettes, and Support Frigates.
* Kushan and Taiidan Support Frigates now keep units docked in Passive tactics and launch units in Offensive tactics. They can also now carry docked units through hyperspace like hw1c.
* Improved the AI's judgement of ship effectiveness values, so it can better build the appropriate counter ships.
* Kushan Drone Frigate's drones no longer produce fighter pilot combat audio.

## Campaign Improvements
### Homeworld 2
#### Mission 9
* After the dreadnaught repairs complete and it undocks, the 'dock dreadnaught' warning bug no longer occurs.

## Balance Changes - All Races
* Friendly fire reduced from 50% to 45% to make it a bit harder for scouts to EMP themselves.

## Hiigaran
* Hiigaran scouts can now EMP frigates with 9 scouts (3 squads), similar to hw2c. Hiigaran scouts aren't very accurate vs fighters, so they have been balanced better vs frigates than vaygr for some race flavor.

## Vaygr
* Vaygr scouts can now EMP frigates with 10 scouts (4 squads), like hw2c.

## Kushan
* Kushan Drone Frigates can now attack while they are moving and the drones stay in a sphere while doing so.


## Other
* Corrected some minor issues from prior builds. Starting the game without a profile, main menu text alignment, "Options>Change Settings>Cancel>Options>Accept" scenario, default race in multiplayer, status audio not playing.
