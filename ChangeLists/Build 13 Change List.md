# Homeworld Remastered 2.3 Players Patch
# Build 13 Change List | December 16, 2019

## Gameplay Options and Features
* Added an option to change the Stance Buttons Order. This changes the order of the stance buttons in the UI to match HWR (Aggressive/Evasive/Neutral) or hw1c (Aggressive/Neutral/Evasive).

## HWR Bugs Fixes and Improvements
* The retaliation range has been reduced significantly on many special ability units. This is to prevent them from moving towards a distant battle on their own, which often leads to them dying without utilizing their special ability. This includes Hiigaran/Vaygr Minelayer Corvettes, Hiigaran Marine Frigates, Hiigaran Defense Field Frigates, Vaygr Infiltrator Frigates, Kushan/Taiidan Repair Corvettes, Minelayer Corvettes, and Support Frigates.
* Kushan and Taiidan Support Frigates now keep units docked in Passive tactics and launch units in Offensive tactics. They can also now carry docked units through hyperspace like hw1c.
* Improved the AI's judgement of ship effectiveness values, so it can better build the appropriate counter ships.
* Fixed Vaygr Battlecruiser gun muzzle effects
* The Kadeshi Fuel Pod tactical overlay icon now uses a frigate icon rather than a probe icon.
* Fixed Vaygr Battlecruiser gun sound effects.
* Fixed Kushan and Taiidan Defenders gun sound effects.
* Fixed Taiidan Repair Corvette gun sound effects.
* Kushan Drone Frigate's drones no longer produce fighter pilot combat audio.
* The survive 40+ minute challenges now play the correct audio.

## Campaign Improvements
* When hyperspacing at the end of a mission, ships are now set to Defensive rather than Passive similar to the classics.
### Homeworld 2
#### Mission 9
* After the dreadnaught repairs complete and it undocks, the 'dock dreadnaught' warning bug no longer occurs.
#### Mission 13
* Dreadnought weapon beam effects are now fully visible.

## Balance Changes - All Races
* Movement speed while being repaired lowered from 95% to 80% (its 65% in v2.1).
* Friendly fire reduced from 50% to 45% to make it a bit harder for scouts to EMP themselves.
* Hiigaran scouts can now EMP frigates with just three squads, rather than six (Hiigaran EMP isn't very accurate vs fighters, so its now a bit better vs frigates than vaygr for some race flavor).
* Vaygr scouts can now EMP frigates with just four squads like hw2c, rather than six.
* Kushan Drone Frigate's drones now attack properly in a sphere while the frigate is moving.
