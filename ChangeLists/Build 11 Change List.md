## Balance
* The balance changes below cover all the changes in build 10 and build 11.
* After the big Homeworld 3 announcement, we decided to release build 10 early. Some balance changes were experimental and were reverted in build 11. The list below covers all balance changes made in build 10 and 11.
* Note, build 10 was released in a hurry following the Homeworld 3 announcement.

* Kushan and Taiidan research costs went up too high in build 9, and have been reduced accordingly in build 10. Fighters -1100ru, Corvettes -1500ru, Frigates -1100ru, Capitals -4700ru, and Non-Combat -700 for a total of -9100ru.
* Mine duration reduced from 200 to 60sec to avoid stalemates.
* All probes can now travel through hyperspace gates, but can not move again after they exit the hyperspace gate.
* Vaygr Hyperspace Gates can now hyperspace to a destination on their own. Slightly increased the built in sensors distortion ability, that helps it hide from probes.
* Non-attackable subsystem icons now appear in the UI for Kushan/Taiidan Motherships and Carriers after researching Fighter, Corvette, Frigate, and Capital Ship research.
* Kushan and Taiidan fighters and corvettes can now be EMP'd with just one squad of Hiigaran/Vaygr scouts, rather than two squads like before.
* Kushan and Taiidan Salvage Corvettes can now kamikaze.
* Kushan Drone Frigates can now attack while they are moving. Previously the drones rarely ever fired while the frig was moving. We plan to continue to improve this ship.
* Kushan and Taiidan Heavy Cruisers no longer take hyperspace damage when they hit a hyperspace inhibitor mid-jump. Hiigaran/Vaygr Cruisers have always been immune to such damage.
* The changes above are just a small sample of the many balance refinements included. The full Build 10 balance change list will be available soon.
