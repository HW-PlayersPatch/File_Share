# Miscellaneous

> *Some interesting changes affecting multiple races this time.*

---

## Fire Control Towers (HW2)
* **Now effect the host ship as well as surrounding ships**

---

## Scuttle radius (HW2)
> *Scuttling motherships is insanely difficult to react to, and effects different races in very different ways. This is a creative strategy and should definitely still be achievable, however opponents should have the ability to respond within a reasonable time window rather than half a second.*
* **Radius:**
  * **Max damage radius:** `1075 => 800` (-25.6%)
  * **Min damage radius:** `1612 => 1200` (-25.6%)

---

## Ion Frigates
> *These units have many issues with tracking its targets. Due to problems with the rm engine, sometimes they can get stuck in a misaligned position too. Upping their attack cone should improve the QOL for this unit, and hopefully help them compete with heavy missiles in a more organic way.*
* **Firing arc:** `6 => 12` (+100%)

---

## 'Normal' unit caps
> *Destroyer balls can be absolutely impossible to stop without cruisers. Six destroyers is just too much of a snowball factor. Toning this back to its 2.1 state.*
* **Destroyers:** `6 => 5` (-16.7%)

---


## 'High' unit caps
> *A tad too heavy on capitals.*
* **Destroyers:** `9 => 7` (-22.2%)
* **Missile Destroyers:** `4 => 3` (-25%%)
* **Heavy Cruisers:** `4 => 3` (-25%)

---

## 'Huge' unit caps
> *Same story.*
* **Destroyers:** `14 => 11` (-21.4%)
