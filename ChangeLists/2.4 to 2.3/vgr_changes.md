# Vaygr

> *Like the Hiigarans, Vaygr have experienced a number of reversions compared to their 2.4 state. This is because several changes to the race were counterbalancing other, prior changes. Instead of that, we've cleaned the slate somewhat. With that said, Vaygr have kept many of their more interesting changes over from 2.4.*

---

## Assault Frigates
> *Some reversions.*
* **HP:** `17500 => 18000` (+2.8%)

---

## Battlecruisers
> *Reverting a 2.4 change. Cruisers were very fragile, however a flat buff would be a step back with this unit. BC range was reduced by 10% in 2.4, we've changed this to be a flat 500 range nerf now. This is because a % nerf was interacting in unexpected ways in cruiser duels due to various factors such as turret placements and the fact that not all cruiser weapons have the same range.*
* **HP:** `160000 => 192000` (+18%)
* **Speed:** `87 => 79` (-10.9%)
* **Weapons:**
  * **Trinity Cannon:**
    * **Range:** `4995 => 5050` (+1.1%)
  * **Fusion Missiles:**
    * **Range:** `5400 => 5500` (+1.9%)

---

## Bombers
> *With the overall improvement to anti-fighter measures across many unit classes, both ints and bombers have felt the strain. While ints have been checked well, the already-underused bombers need a little love.*
* **Speed:** `279 => 300` (+7.3%)
* **Weapons:**
	* **All bombs now have same projectile speed:** `1200 => 1800` (+50%)

---

## Carriers
> *Minmaxing the cost of production speed upgrades.*
* **Research:**
  * **Production speed upgrade:**
    * **Cost:** `2250 => 2500` (+11.1%)

---

## Command Corvettes
> *The best fire control in the game for 400ru is quite crazy. Bringing the cost of this unit more in-line with its value, but also adding some needed survivability to the unit.*
* **Cost:** `400 => 750` (+55.6%)
* **HP:** `900 => 1000` (+11.1%)

---

## CORVETTES
> *See the entry on Missile Corvettes.*
* **Research:**
  * **HP upgrade:**
    * **Multiplier:** `1.35 => 1.5` (+11.1%)

---

## Corvette Facilities
> *Another case of buffs to offset other nerfs. With other reversions, this can go back to its old state.*
* **Cost:** `850 => 725` (-14.7%)
* **Time:** `65 => 60` (-7.7%)

---

## Destroyers
> *Destroyers overall had their damage cut against resourcing. This has made them extremely linear in their gameplan as they are hard pressed to inflict logistical damage without significant numbers. Reverting this. For some reason Vaygr destroyers had their damage against swarm was essentially removed - Vaygr destroyers have historically always been able to dent strike clouds at least a little. Revert. Finally, Destroyers were a little undesirable compared to lasers or heavy missiles due to the cost of fielding them. Slight buff here.*
* **Research:**
  * **Unit unlock:**
    * **Cost:** `2000 => 1750` (-12.5%)
* **Weapons:**
  * **Fusion Missiles:**
    * **Damage Multipliers::**
      * **vs Resourcing:** `0.1 => 0.2` (+100%)
  * **Flachette Cannons:**
    * **Damage Multipliers:**
      * **vs all Fighters:** `0.005 => 0.01` (+100%)
      * **vs all Corvettes::** `0.005 => 0.01` (+100%)

## Flagship
> *Minmaxing production time upgrades.*
* **Research:**
  * **Production time upgrade:**
    * **Cost:** `1750 => 1000` (-42.9%)

---

## Heavy Missile Frigates
> *Heavy missiles being rolled back. With buffs elsewhere, these should hopefully be all that's needed to bring them in-line.*
* **Research:**
  * **Unit unlock:**
    * **Cost:** `1600 => 1800` (+12.5%)
    * **Time:** `110 => 120` (+9.1%)

---

## Hyperspace Platforms
> *Normalised the speed boys (probes) to 600 movespeed. Gates want to maintain this speed too. Gates themselves now a little more survivable so you can actually use them once before they get popped.*
* **Research:**
  * **Unit unlock:**
    * **Cost:** `750 => 500` (33.3%)
    * **Time:** `50 => 45` (-10%)

  * **Vision range:** `1000 => 4000` (+300%)
  * **Primary sensors range:** `4000 => 7500` (+87.5%)
  * **Secondary sensors range:** `4000 => 7500` (+87.5%)

---

## Hyperspace Sensors
> *Reversion here.*
* **Cost:** `750 => 500` (-33.3%)

---

## Lance Fighters
> *Overperforming somewhat against vettes. Maybe a lot.*
* **Weapons:**
  * **Lance Beam:**
    * **Damage Multipliers::**
      * **vs HW2 Corvettes:** `1.0 => 0.65` (-35%)
      * **vs HW1 Corvettes:** `1.45 => 1.25` (-13.8%)

---

## Laser Corvettes
> *Overperforming a little. Currently beating out the other options Vaygr have in their role - toning these down just a tad.*
* **Research:**
  * **Unit unlock:**
    * **Time:** `45 => 60` (33.33%)

---

## Minelayer Corvettes
> *A little more survibable, so they can actually do their job without dying to a single sweep of one lance squad, or a stray destroyer hit.*
* **HP:** `900 => 1000` (+11.1%)

---

## Missile Corvettes
> *Reverting the normalisation between base and upgraded HP for now. This change needs to be more universal if attempted again.*
* **HP:** `510 => 480` (-5.9%)
* **Weapons:**
  * **Missiles:**
    * **Damage Multipliers::**
      * **vs Frigates:** `0.42 => 0.6` (+42.9%)

## Mobile Refineries
> *Go backstab these guys.*
* **HP:** `18000 => 16000` (-11.8%)

---

## Probes
> *Part of wider nerfs to vision overall.*
* **Cost:** `100 => 120` (+20%)
* **Vision:**
  * **Vision range:** `5000 => 4000` (-20%)
  * **Primary sensors range:** `12000 => 10000` (-18.1%)
  * **Secondary sensors range:** `12000 => 10000` (-18.1%)

---

## Proximity Sensors
> *Part of wider nerfs to vision overall. This unit is a very hard counter to cloak, but also to sensor distortion (distortion probes only affect sensors, not 'vision'). As such, we'd like to see the buffed distortion probes actually carve a niche without being shut down effortlessly by proxys.*
* **Research:**
  * **Unit unlock:**
	* **Cost:** `600 => 500` (-18.1%)
* **Build time:** `15 => 20` (+33%)

---

## Sensor Distortion Probes
> *Part of wider nerfs to vision overall.*
* **Vision:**
  * **Vision range:** `5000 => 4000` (-20%)
  * **Primary sensors range:** `16000 => 14000` (-12.5%)
  * **Secondary sensors range:** `16000 => 14000` (-12.5%)

---

## Scouts
> *Scouts should not be able to cut through dust clouds. There are units dedicated to this role (probes, proxies).*
* **Vision:**
  * **Vision range:** `4000 => 1500` (-62.5%)

---

## Shipyards
> *See the entry on the Flagship*
