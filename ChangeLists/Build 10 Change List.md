# Homeworld Remastered Players Patch
# Build 10 Change List | August 31, 2019

## Gameplay Options and Features
* Added a Dual Command mode to allow one player to control two fleets. Change your race to a Dual Command race, and then change a CPU ally to the same Dual Command race. You will start with two fleets, double the starting RUs, double the research costs, and will have double the unit caps.
* Observer mode has been improved. When prompted to continue watching, click yes to observe.
* Added a Camera Rotation Speed adjuster. This lets players increase the camera speed to rotate faster with the right mouse button.
* Added a Max Tactical Overlay level that keeps unit feedback lines and ability spheres on all the time if desired.
* Added an option set the Default Tactical Overlay. This adjusts the default level of detail for the tactical overlay around units.
* Added an option to Show Base Production Times. This displays the base production times for ships and research items in the production popup menus. The value of research modifiers are also shown.

## HWR Bugs Fixes and Improvements
* Prevented attempting to hyperspace ships inside a hyperspace inhibitor. This resolves the exploit to reset marine/infiltrator frigate capture progress for free, which previously rendered them useless. This hyperspace in gravity well exploit has finally been fixed!
* When salvage corvettes latch on and return enemy frigate/capital ships to their mothership or carrier, an exploit allowed those ships to be scuttled right before they were captured. This prevented salvage corvettes from capturing frigate/capital ships, however the salvage scuttle exploit has now been fixed!
* Addressed kamikaze exploits that allowed cheap ships to kill expensive ships, and that allowed squadrons to kill targets and then dock-heal for free.
* When a docking squadron is under attack, they sometimes glitch out and stop moving. Affected Squadrons are now automatically issued another dock order to dock with the closest ship.
* The Kushan/Taiidan Gravity Well ability previously continued to lock down strikecraft in an area after it had moved away. The area of affect now stays with the Gravity Well.
* Fixed the bug that allowed Kushan/Taiidan players to build two research ships at once on separate carriers.
* The score screen now treats ru spent on subsystems the same as ru spent on research for the building and research score total.
* Slightly changed the advanced research module icon to differentiate it more from the regular research module icon.
* When a private message is sent, everyone in the lobby hears the audio alert even when they are not the recipient. As a workaround the audio alert has been removed, as the chat window already visually flashes for the recipient.
* Hiigaran Marine Frigates, Vaygr Infiltrator Frigates, and all Minelayer corvettes are no longer included in the military selection priority. This prevents accidentally de-latching capture frigates, or messing up mine walls.
* ‘Platform Complete’ audio is now played for Vaygr Gun Platforms and Missile Platforms.
* In the carrier only gamemode, all races now start with the same number of carriers.
* The 'No Cruisers' game option text now displays in your current locale language rather than always in English.
* Reduced the Kushan probe death explosion to an appropriate size.

## Campaign Improvements
**Homeworld 1**
* Bentusi Trade research costs have been increased to align with normal research costs. However if your in a bind, you may be offered a discount.
* The RU available on each mission has been tweaked to account for the Kushan research cost changes below.

## Balance
* Following the Homeworld 3 announcement in August, we decided to release build 10 early as a 'work in progress'. Some changes are experimental and will be further refined in September. A detailed balance change list will be included with build 11.
