Description:
The Homeworld Remastered 2.3 Players Patch resolves many balance issues and bugs from the 2.1 Patch. It includes the changes from Gearboxâ€™s unfinished 2.205 Patch Preview, plus many additional improvements. It enhances multiplayer and singleplayer while respecting Gearbox's direction, and the feel of Relic's classics. Notably it fixes the 666 Formation Bug, the Cross Race Docking Bug, and is authored by the players who helped Gearbox balance Homeworld Remastered. It also features additional gameplay options including a campaign difficulty adjuster, camera zoom adjuster, observer mode, vast unit caps, and more.
