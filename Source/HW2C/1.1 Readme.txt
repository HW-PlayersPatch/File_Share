Non-standard Resolutions

Homeworld2 has been designed for the standard 4:3 aspect ratio display. However, you can use other any unsupported resolutions of your choosing, such as those listed below. Furthermore, We have included a solution for some non-standard resolutions as listed below. If you're running Homeworld2 on a laptop or other LCD display, you may experience some distortion or stretching of the game screens if you're not running in the recommended resolutions for your specific monitor. 

To address this, we've included the following work-around using a command line option switch. In order to specify the resolution that you want to play Homeworld2 in, use the following parameters to set your resolution. Simply cut and paste from the text below into the Homeworld2 shortcut Properties 

For Example, the Target of your windows shortcut should read:
 
C:\Programs\Sierra\Homeworld2\Homeworld2.exe.

And if you want to run Homeworld2 in 1024 x 768 resolution, using the following command line switch (typed exactly as):

-w 1024 -h 768   

(**note the case sensitive and space sensitive nature of this command line switch where 
-w sets the width value and the -h sets the height value.)

Therefore, if you want to run Homeworld2 in 1024 x 768 resolution, the 'Target' field of the Windows shortcut for Homeworld2 should read:

"C:\Programs\Sierra\Homeworld2\Homeworld2.exe" -w 1024 -h 768

You can try using this method to run in any one of the resolutions listed below or others that may not be listed. However, none of them are guaranteed to work in all cases. Here are several examples. Simply cut and paste from the text below into target line after the .exe portion of the existing text.

1152x864		-w 1152 -h 864	
1920x1440		-w 1920 -h 1440
2048x1536		-w 2048 -h 1536


III. GENERAL TECHNICAL ISSUES
----------------------------

i. Multiplayer Issues
Modem users may experience connectivity problems when playing Homeworld 2 on Gamespy while running a personal firewall (such as ZoneAlarm or Norton Personal Firewall). Disabling the firewall during play may solve those problems.

If you want to play a multiplayer game of Homeworld 2 and you are behind a router, you may need to do one of the following:
 a) Disable your router so that your machine is connected directly to the internet.
 b) Unblock port 6073 and ports 2302 to 2400 (these are the default DirectPlay ports used by Homeworld 2).
 c) Force Homeworld2 to use a given port number by using "-port ####" at the command line, where #### is between 1 and 65535.

If you still encounter difficulty in connecting to GameSpy, please allow traffic for at least the following TCP ports.
	6667 (IRC) 
	80 (HTTP) 
	27900 (Master Server UDP Heartbeat) 
	28900 (Master Server List Request) 
	29900 (GP Connection Manager) 
	29901 (GP Search Manager) 
	13139 (Custom UDP Pings) 
	6500  (incoming, UDP, default roomquery port; can be customized with roomqueryport=<port #> in svc.cfg) 


ii. Dual Monitor Setup
You will not be able to play Homeworld 2 on your secondary monitor unless both are running from the same supported video card. If you have two video cards, the primary card must be supported by Homeworld 2 or the game will not run.

iii. Troubleshooting
You may experience various display problems depending on your system specifications. Below are the current known issues.
a) Alt-Tabbing out of and back into Homeworld 2 may cause certain ships to render improperly.
b) Homeworld 2 does not run on Windows 98 SE systems that use CMI 8738 Onboard Sound Card. Playing with a different sound card or by disabling sound entirely (by using the -noSound command line parameter) will allow the game to run.


IV. GENERAL GAME ISSUES
----------------------------

i. CD Keys
Please remember, no one from Sierra will ever ask you for your key. If someone logs onto GameSpy using your CD key while you are in a GameSpy lobby or game, you will be kicked out.
Remember, do not give out your CD key to anyone or you will not be able to play multiplayer games!

ii. Graphics Settings
Homeworld 2's default graphics quality settings are set to low. If you want to experience the full visual experience of Homeworld 2, you will need to set these values to high.

iii. Installation of DirectX9.0
Homeworld 2 requires DirectX9.0 or higher in order to run. You will be prompted to install DirectX9 during the installation process. If you have already installed or want to install DirectX9 later, please select no. 
Note: If you select no during the installation process, you must install DirectX9.0 manually before Homeworld 2 will run.

iv. Gamespy Arcade
While Homeworld 2 provides Gamespy Arcade as an optional part of the installation process, Homeworld 2 is not supported by it. If you want to play a multiplayer game on Gamespy, please select the GameSpy option provided in the front end.

v. Content Download
Unique player Badges must be placed in your bin/profiles/badges/ directory. Badges downloaded from other players will be placed in this folder as well.
 
Levels will be downloaded to your bin/profiles/levels folder and be placed in a folder with a unique id. If you want to host a game with a downloaded map, please ensure that you copy it to your data/leveldata/multiplayer/deathmatch/ folder
