60512	Hyperspace successful.  Current position and pre-jump coordinates are in perfect alignment.  We are on target.
60513	We detect large resource deposits but no vessels.  It is possible that the Taiidan could be hiding in the denser portions of the belt. It may cause interference with our sensors.  Send probes to investigate.  All fleet assets should be kept on alert.

60518	Research Division reports it is now equipped for Ion Cannon technology.  We advise commencing research immediately.
60519	Research Division reports it is now equipped for Plasma Bomb technology.  We advise commencing research immediately.
60520	Sensors indicate the enemy is harvesting resources.  Destroy their collector to impair ship production.
60521	Enemy capital ships appear to be most heavily armored on the front and sides.  Our capital ships should be issued move orders while attacking to take advantage of the more vulnerable sides.
60522	The enemy is using a new Fighter class ship with strong defensive capabilities but low maneuverability.  Our Research Division reports that it can produce a similar vessel.  Begin research as soon as possible.
