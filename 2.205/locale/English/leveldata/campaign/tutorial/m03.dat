51028	This tutorial covers Control Groups, Special Actions and Advanced Commands.
51031	Control Groups allow you to select a group of ships and assign them to one of the 10 number keys. Click OK to Continue.#+
51032	First, select the 3 squadrons of Interceptors.
51040	Now press the CTRL key and the NUMBER ONE at the same time to assign the Interceptors to Group 1.
51050	You have now assigned that group to the number 1.
51051	From now on, pressing the NUMBER 1 key, or clicking on the ONE icon on the task bar, will select Group One. Click OK to Continue.#+
51052	Pressing the NUMBER 1 twice will also focus the Camera on the Interceptors.
51055	Up to 10 Groups can be assigned, each corresponding to one of the Number Keys.#+
51054	Now assign the newly arrived Bombers to Group 2.
51060	Excellent.  Now order Group 2 to attack the Enemy Frigate that has just hyperspaced in.
51070	Well done.
51090	The next lesson covers Special Actions.
51091	Special actions vary from ship to ship.
51092	The Carrier that has just arrived has a Cloaking Generator.
51100	To use Special Actions, first select the Carrier.
51101	Now click on the Special Actions Tab in the Taskbar.
51102	This tab displays all Special Actions. Currently only the CLOAK ABILITY ICON is active.

51110	Special Actions are also activated via the SHIFT MENU.
51111	To access the SHIFT MENU, HOLD DOWN SHIFT, and RIGHT-CLICK on a ship or empty space.
51112	Using either the Special Actions commands icons menu on the taskbar, or the SHIFT MENU, order the Carrier to de-cloak.
51120	Unlike Cloak, some Special Actions require a target.
51121	This Marine Frigate is one such example.
51122	Marine Frigates are used to capture enemy ships.
51162	To capture an enemy ship, select the Marine Frigate and RIGHT-CLICK on the enemy Frigate.
51163	You can also use the CAPTURE ICON or the Shift Menu.
51130	Well done.
51132	You have now successfully completed the final Tutorial for Homeworld.
51140	When you are done, press F10 to return to the menu. #+
52000	Tactics will be covered next.
52001	Idle ships will default to their Tactics setting. Tactics govern how ships react to the enemy targets. Click OK to Continue. #+
52003	Units set on Aggressive will retaliate against all enemy targets.
52004	Ships on Defensive will defend friendly ships, but will not pursue enemy targets. This is the default tactic.
52005	Passive Tactics order units to stand down. They will not engage the enemy under any circumstances.
52006	Tactics will also change the formations ships use. Click OK to continue. #+
52007	To change Tactics for selected ships, click on the desired Tactic on the taskbar.
52008	You can also use the Tactics Hotkeys. #+
52009	Ships on Sentry will hold their position while firing on incoming enemies.
52010	Strikegroups are tactical formations of ships designed to support each other in battle. Click OK to Continue.  #+
52011	Drag select all of these ships.
52013	Now, select a Strikegroup formation from the STRIKEGROUP Roll Out on the task bar.
52012	Well done.  Strikegroups are more efficient than the collection of their parts.
52014	However, you will notice that a Strikegroup will only travel as quickly as its slowest unit.
52015	Therefore a Strikegroup is a tradeoff between speed and efficiency. #+
52019	You can set Tactics for an entire Strikegroup, or for elements individually. Click OK to Continue. #+
52016	You now have full understanding of all the commands available in Homeworld.
52017	If you wish to practice these skills, you will be confronted by ever increasing Vaygr strike forces. #+
52018	If you wish to play the full game, press esc to return to the menu.
51053	Good Job.
52030	Waypoints allow you to move your ships along specified paths. This can be used to move around asteroid fields or to set up sneak attacks. Click OK to Continue.#+
52031	Click on the WAYPOINT ICON (hotkey: W) to enter Waypoint mode.
52032	While in this mode, you can queue a series of move commands. Your ships will move to each destination point in sequence. Practice this now.
52033	To end the waypoint, simply click on the Waypoint icon, the hotkey (W) or press ESC.#+
52034	Waypoints can also be used to issue common commands such as Attack or Harvest.
52035	However, once a command is issued, the waypoint path ends at that point.
